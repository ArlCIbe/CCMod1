### LAYOUT

##### Every HTML element has a default **display** value, which controls how it shows up on a WP. The default display is usually **block** or **inline** and is depenedent on the browser.

#### Block-level - starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as possible).

- flex - creates a block-level flex container
- grid - creates a block-level grid container

#### Inline - doesn't start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

- inline-flex - creates an inline-level flex container
- inline-grid - creates an inline-level grid container
- inline-table - creates an inline-level table

##### inline-block - creates an inline-level block container; the element itself is formatted as an inline element, but you can apply height and width values.
