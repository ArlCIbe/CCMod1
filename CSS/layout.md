#### every HTML element has a default **display** value,, which controls how it shows up on a WP. the default display is usually **block** or **inline** and is dependent on the browser.

### Block-level - starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as possible).

### Inline - doesn't start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
